## *What I learned* 🤓

🔳 **Text Case Manipulation:** I learned to use CSS properties like `text-transform` to control text capitalization and better adapt the visual style of content.

🔳 **Viewport Units:** I used viewport-relative units (`vw`, `vh`) to create a design that adapts to different screen sizes.

🔳 **Flexbox Order:** By applying the order property in Flexbox, I could reorganize elements at different resolutions, improving the visual structure on mobile devices.

🔳 **Box-sizing:** I gained a deeper understanding of how `box-sizing: border-box` affects the total size of elements and how to use it to create balanced and aligned layouts.

🔳 **Styling Form Elements and Modifiers:** I experimented with styling form elements, including input fields, buttons, and hover/focus styles, to enhance user experience and accessibility.
